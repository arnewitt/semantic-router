# semantic-router

A simple webserver that assigns objects to categories based on the meaning of their content rather than predefined rules.

The idea behind semantic routing and underlying concepts are described in [this notebook](./notebooks/introduction.ipynb). This is not a new idea and this project is intended only for demonstration purposes.
